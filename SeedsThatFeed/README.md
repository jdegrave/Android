#Seeds that Feed Android App
[Seeds that Feed](https://seedsfeed.org) distributes locally-sourced, fresh produce to disenfranchised and lower economic members of the community. 
This app was  my final project for my Java course (Dec 2015). 

##Final Project Requirements
1. Define a class
2. Instantiate a class
3. At least one selection statement
4. At least one loop statement
5. At least 1 UML diagram:
   * Activity Diagram
   * Class Diagram
   * Object Diagram
   * Sequence Diagram
6. Requirements Document


###NOTE:  Please review the documentation to formulate a better picture of what the finished product will be. 
          Due to time limitations in the course, there is no user input (yet) in this app.


## Additional Project Documentation
Includes the project charter, terms of engagement and more. Seeds That Feed granted permission to make this
accessible to potential employers
